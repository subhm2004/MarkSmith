## ⚙️ Setup Locally

You can run this project locally on your system to test, develop or contribute.

### 🍫 Requirements

To run this project, make sure you have the following installed:

| Tool      | Why it's needed?                                      |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) | Backend runtime to run JavaScript outside the browser. |
| [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)       | Node package manager to install project dependencies. |
| [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (optional) | To clone the repository directly from GitHub.          |

---

### ⚒ Common Setup

#### 🔽 Step 1: Clone the repository

Clone the codebase from GitHub to your local system using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/subhm2004/MarkSmith.git
```
#### 📁 Step 2: Navigate into the project directory
```bash
cd MarkSmith
```
 This moves your terminal into the project folder you just cloned.
 
 #### 📦 Step 3: Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```
This reads the `package.json` file and installs all required libraries (like React, PrismJS etc.) into a `node_modules` folder.  
Without this step, your app won’t work.

## 🧪 Run in Development Mode

To start a local development server with hot-reload:
```bash
npm start
```
-   This command launches the app at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
    
-   Any code changes you make will automatically reflect in the browser.
    
-   Useful error/warning messages will appear in the terminal or browser console.
## 📦 Create a Production Build
To create a production-ready, optimized build:
```bash
npm run build
```
This generates a `build/` directory with:

-   ✅ Minified JS and CSS
    
-   📸 Optimized images
    
-   🔁 Hashed filenames for better caching
    
-   🚀 Ready for deployment on platforms like Netlify, Vercel, Firebase, GitHub Pages, etc.
## 🚀 Ready to Deploy
Once you have a build, you can host it on:

-   **Netlify**: Drag and drop the `/build` folder in the dashboard
    
-   **Vercel**: Auto-deploy from GitHub repository
    
-   **Firebase Hosting**
    
-   **GitHub Pages**
